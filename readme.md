In this repository, i have tried to revise @reduxjs/toolkit.

I have revised these things

1. what is redux
2. what is action and reducer
3. what is middlewares
4. what is createSlice and configureStore methods
5. what is dispatch and selector
6. what is mapDispatchToProps and mapStateToProps methods
7. what is connect
8. what is combinedReducer
9. how to create redux store
10. what is slice and how to create it
11. how to prepare data before sending it to reducer
12. how to call apis in redux?

For all these above things, i have created a simple application where 
1. Calling users and posts api and then saving them into redux store
2. Accessing posts and users from redux store in PostsList component and then showing them in list format.
3. User can create a new post by AddNewPost form.
